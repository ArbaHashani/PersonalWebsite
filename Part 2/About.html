                    <h2>Precision, Speed, and Leadership on the Court</h2>
                    <p>As a player, I bring a strong combination of skill, leadership, and strategic thinking to the game. My primary position is point guard (PG) or 1, the shooting guard (SG) or 2 where I excel in my key strengths: shooting, passing, defense, court vision, etc. My style is defined by precision and speed, allowing me to adapt quickly to different game situations. I take pride in my ability to read the court, make smart decisions under pressure, and contribute both offensively and defensively. Whether it’s creating opportunities for my teammates or taking the lead when needed, I strive to be a well-rounded and reliable player.</p>

                        <h3>Shaped by Passion, Driven by Greatness</h3>
                        <p>My basketball journey has been shaped by many people who have inspired me along the way. My biggest influence has been my dad, whose passion for basketball first introduced me to the game. Training with him instilled discipline and perseverance in me from an early age. Beyond family, I admire professional basketball player Kelsey Plum, whose dedication, work ethic, and leadership qualities serve as motivation. Coaches, teammates, and mentors have also played a crucial role in my growth, pushing me to improve every day. Their support has been invaluable in shaping me into the player I am today.</p>

                        <h3>Building a Better Me, Inside and Outside the Game</h3>
                        <p>While basketball is a major part of my life, I also have passions outside the game. I enjoy fitness training, traveling, and watching movies, which help me stay balanced and continuously grow as an individual. Living abroad on my own has been a transformative experience, allowing me to step outside my comfort zone and adapt to new cultures and environments. This journey has not only made me more independent but has also taught me invaluable life lessons in resilience and self-reliance.

Community involvement is important to me, and I have participated in various basketball camps and European championship events. I believe that personal development extends beyond the court, and I constantly seek ways to improve myself both mentally and physically. Whether it's through my hobbies or by engaging with others, I continue to grow as a person every day.</p>

                        <h3>Embracing Hard Work, Resilience, and the Drive to Inspire</h3>
                        <p>My basketball journey has imparted invaluable lessons that go beyond the game itself. I believe deeply in the power of hard work, resilience, and self-discipline. Success isn't just a product of natural talent—it's about dedication, perseverance, and the courage to push past limits. One of the toughest challenges I've faced was injuring my ankle ligaments, which tested my mental and physical strength. The recovery process was long and demanding, but it only reinforced my belief that challenges are opportunities to grow. I’ve learned to embrace setbacks, using them as motivation to come back stronger. I continuously seek ways to improve both as a player and as a person. My ultimate goal is not only to become the best version of myself but also to inspire others to pursue their dreams with the same passion and commitment. Whether on or off the court, I strive to lead by example and make a lasting, positive impact.</p>
