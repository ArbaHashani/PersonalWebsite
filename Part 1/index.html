                    <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
                    <p>It all started when I was 11 years old in the sixth grade. At the time, I was passionate about football, but everything changed the day I saw my dad and uncle playing basketball. There was something captivating about the game — I simply fell in love. From that moment, I joined a local basketball club in my city, where I practiced three times a week. I was the only girl on the team, but that never discouraged me. On the days I didn’t have official practice, I would train with my dad, pushing myself to improve. Those early experiences shaped my passion and determination for the game. Everyday the love for this game just got stronger.

                        <h2>Milestones that Define Success</h2>
                        <p>Throughout my basketball career, I have had the privilege of achieving significant success both nationally and internationally. I have represented Kosovo at various prestigious European Championship events, including the FIBA U16 Women’s European Championship in 2017 (Gibraltar, Division C), 2018 (Podgorica, Division B), and 2019 (Sofia, Division B). I also competed in the FIBA U18 Women’s European Championship in 2019 (Skopje, Division B), and the FIBA U20 Women’s European Championship in 2021 (Skopje, Division B), 2022 (Skopje, Division B), and 2023 (Craiova, Division B). Domestically, I have enjoyed great success with various teams. As a captain of BC Kerasan Prishtina, I led the team to win the Kosovo Championship in 2015 and the Kosovo Cup in 2016. In the Kosovo Super League, I played for both Bashkimi and Prishtina, winning the Super Cup, the Cup, and the Championship in 2019. Additionally, I’ve had the opportunity to participate in various prestigious camps and tournaments, including The Basketball Embassy Camp in San Antonio, Texas (2018), the FIBA European Women’s Basketball Summit in Slovenia,and several Akdeniz Basketball Camps in Turkey. My achievements have been recognized both in local competitions, where I was named the best player in the municipality of Prishtina, and I was honored as MVP of the FIBA Europe Girls "Her World, Her Rules" program held in Kosovo. I have played from 2021-2023 for the LCC Moose Basketball team. I have gained experience playing in the Lithuanian and Baltic leagues.</p>

                        <h3>Overcoming Obstacles and Evolving</h3>
                        <p>Basketball has taught me discipline, resilience, the value of hard work and teamwork. It’s not just about skill—it's about pushing through challenges, staying focused, and working relentlessly. The sport has shown me that growth comes from overcoming setbacks and staying committed, even when it’s tough. Some challenges in basketball that I faced were balancing intense trainings with other responsibilities, dealing with a serious injurie, and handling pressure during important games. All of the challenges that I faced were worth it, just made me stronger.</p>

                        <p>As a basketball player, I see a future filled with growth and opportunity. I envision leading my team with confidence, competing in the Superleague of Kosovo, and performing at my best through constant training and dedication. Bringing back my experience from the Lithuanian league home.  Beyond the court, I aim to be a role model, inspiring others to work hard, stay focused, and achieve goals. Success will be measured not just by wins, but by personal development and the positive impact I can make on others and the sport.</p>
