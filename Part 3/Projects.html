                    <h3>Using Basketball to Connect, Empower, and Lead</h3>
                    <p>Basketball is more than just a game—it’s a way to connect with and inspire others. I have been involved in various community-driven projects, such as basketball camps, youth mentorship programs, and charity events. Programs like the FIBA Europe “Her World, Her Rules” initiative have given me opportunities to encourage young girls to pursue basketball. Additionally, I have participated in training camps that focus on both skill development and leadership, helping to shape the next generation of athletes.

                        <p>
                         Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of collaborating with different organizations, teams, and brands that share a passion for basketball. My journey has taken me to international tournaments, special training sessions, and networking events that allowed me to connect with professionals in the sport.
						 Working with The Basketball Embassy Camp in Texas, FIBA European Women’s Basketball Summit in Slovenia, and Akdeniz Basketball Camps in Turkey has strengthened my game and expanded my experience in high-level basketball environments.

                        <p>
                            I am always striving to improve my game by participating in training programs and personal development projects. Whether it’s refining my shooting technique or practicing different game strategies, I dedicate time to developing my skills. 
							Competing in the Lithuanian and Baltic leagues has exposed me to new playing styles and higher levels of competition, giving me valuable experience that I bring back—not only to my home league in Kosovo but also to my next opportunities. 
							My journey is all about continuous growth, and I remain committed to pushing my limits every day.

                        <p>
                           Beyond playing, I enjoy sharing my journey and experiences with others. I’ve been featured in interviews, highlight reels, and on platforms that promote basketball. Whether it's through social media, blogs, or videos, I aim to document my growth and motivate young athletes. 
						   I also have a YouTube channel where I post game highlights, and through it, I've received offers from teams in both Europe and the US.
